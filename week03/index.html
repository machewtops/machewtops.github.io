        meaning can be changed with a simple crop.

        a dinner with jesus could instead be about each individual wedding guest, 
        or a grand landscape set in the sky with people staring at the birds.
        <br><br>
        the ability to reproduce and view art in new contexts allows us to see different
        meanings, rather than the overarching image, and to craft a story out of reality.

    <p id="context">
      today, we lack a lot of context commonly found with previous forms of work,
      where instead context can be changed and altered to represent something new. This extends past just
      artwork, but with the ways we convey information through news, television, social media, and other
      forms of conveying information, all made more convenient through forms of the internet and social media.

      art changes meaning based off of your surrounding environment & context when you percieve it.<br>

      as art begins to become valued more as an asset than as a piece of art, societies understanding of 
      art begins to become a way to represent your wealth in a simple depiction. This used to be the case with oil paintings,
      but has transformed itself into a digital age with the creation of NFTs. The idea of owning an image, and being the only 
      person to have access to it, is just a new way to flex your money and wealth through an asset such as art, similar to
      sing expensive materials like in the past.
