                the audacity to create something new with the human brain, to pursue something that 
                has previously not existed in this world. to play god with the tools given to us, as

                to organism, to species, to continue growth and learning to adapt to the world around us. 
                to play god with the tools given to us, as simple as they are, and instead of listening to 
                the rules of nature, adapting the world around us. communication. to learn how to convey 
                ideas to a cause greater than ourselves, to leave a legacy beyond our own lifespan, to work 
                on an issue that might work over multiple human lifespans. to learn and to teach, to pass 
                onto new generations is to create the next stage of evolution. an arms race of knowledge, 
                exponentially growing as opposed to traditional evolution where the general public grows 
                together. people can, and will be left behind with education, through small groups and 
                closed circles. to create artificial intelligence, and centralize what has previously been 
                gatekept, is to create a weapon with knowledge. every individuals ai will enable them to 
                work faster, harder, better, smarter, and use it and train it as a private tool for their 
                use. this inequality of education, is just another medium, but each medium creates a more 
                complex message. the core of communication remains the same, but these letters and numbers 
                form together in complex patterns capable of new levels of interpretation. each medium 
                represents a different era of history, a different style of communication, instrinsical to 
                our evolution as a species, and as a society as a whole. even in our moments of closed off 
                information, like the dark ages, there was still a forwards progression, just hidden from 
                the masses. some mediums are open source, some are closed off, but they all continue to evolve 
                and work towards designing, and redesigning what already exists as a further reinvention of 
                the world as a whole. the medium is the massage.
