              <p class = "para1"> Pugs are small dogs with wrinkly faces and curly tails. I like pug dogs a lot. They come in a variety of colors. These are some of the colors: fawn, black, and silver. The pugs are my favorite dogs. My favorites are also the golden retriever dog, the shiba dog, the black labrador dog, the chihuaha dog. Pugs are known for being friendly and loyal. This is good because it is a good thing to be friendly and loyal. Pugs can sometimes have trouble breathing because of their short snouts. This is not good for the pug dogs who have trouble breathing because fo theri short snouts. They make great companions for people who want a small, affectionate dog. </p>
