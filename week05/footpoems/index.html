            <p>
                Your feet and toes, my love, are like the sun, <br>
                Warm and bright, my heart they've won, <br>
                They guide me through the path of life, <br>
                Through every joy and every strife. <br>
                <br>
                Each toe, so perfect in its own way, <br>
                A little world to love and play, <br>
                A world I cherish, a world I hold, <br>
                A world of love, more precious than gold. <br>
                <br>
                Your feet, so gentle, so soft and sweet, <br>
                A soothing balm, to my tired feet, <br>
                They wrap around me, with tender care, <br>
                A love so deep, beyond compare. <br>
                <br>
                And when the day is done, my dear, <br>
                And we rest our feet, without a fear, <br>
                We know that they will be, forevermore, <br>
                Our faithful guide, our anchor, our shore. <br>
                <br>
                So let us cherish, your feet and toes, <br>
                For they are the source, of love that grows, <br>
                Let us be grateful, for all they give, <br>
                For in them, we find, the reason to live.
